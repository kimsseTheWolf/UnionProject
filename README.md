# Union Project - A Brand-new Project File Manager

While we are using our own computers, we always have a very bad time in organizing all the files together and build our own library for our own projects. But from today, by having this tool, you can manage and make all your files together in a project for just a few seconds. Download the source code above and run the `start.bat` to start progressing!

This guide will tell you some very basic terms and ways to progress all your files. It's not very difficult to understand!

**NOTE:** The console has already stopped support since Aug. 21th, 2022.



## Basic Definitions

**Category:**

You can understand this command the same as the `repository or tag`, your can classify all your projects into different category and everything between the categories are seperated.

**Project:**

A project is a unity of all your files which serves your current Project. You can put any kinds of files inside the projects and this program will help you to unite and organize all your files in this project automatically. The only thing you have to do is adding files, open files, move files, or delete or dissociate the files.

**Files:**

This is the basic-unit of our program. Everything in this program (Categories and Projects) are made by files.
